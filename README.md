**Image Colorizer**
This project utilizes a deep learning model to colorize black-and-white images. The model is based on a pre-trained Caffe model. The application allows users to upload a grayscale image, process it with the colorization model, and download the colorized image.

**Features**
Upload black and white images.

Colorize the uploaded image using a deep learning model.

Download the colorized image.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

Flask: A web framework for creating the web app.

OpenCV: For image processing.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Caffe Model: Pre-trained model for colorization.

**Download the necessary model files:**
